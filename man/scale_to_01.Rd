\title{Scale Numeric Vector to Range [0, 1]}
\usage{
scale_to_01(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector containing values from a PRNG or other numeric data.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector where each element is rescaled to fall within the range [0, 1].
If all values in `x` are identical, the function returns a vector of zeros of the same length.
}
\description{
This function scales a numeric vector to a range between 0 and 1. Primarily intended for
processing output from Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs), this scaling
transforms values into a standardized range, facilitating downstream analysis
and comparative studies.
}
\details{
The formula used for rescaling each element \eqn{x_i} in the vector \eqn{x} is:
\deqn{x_{scaled} = \frac{x_i - \text{min}(x)}{\text{max}(x) - \text{min}(x)}}

This method of normalization ensures values are linearly scaled, and is commonly used
in probabilistic modeling, machine learning, and simulations to transform data
into a uniform range [0, 1]. Note that the method may produce NaN values if
`x` is a constant vector, which is handled as a special case.
}
\examples{
# Example with PRNG values
set.seed(42)
prng_values <- runif(10, min = -5, max = 5)
scaled_values <- scale_to_01(prng_values)
print(scaled_values)
