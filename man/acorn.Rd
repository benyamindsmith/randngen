\title{ACORN Random Number Generator}
\usage{
acorn(seed, n, k = 1L, M = 1073741824L)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{Initial seed value for the generator. Must satisfy 0 < seed < M.
All internal states are initialized to this seed value.}

\item{n}{Number of random values to generate. Must be non-negative.}

\item{k}{Order of the generator (default = 1). Higher orders generally provide
better statistical properties. The original ACORN algorithm recommends k = 10
for production use. Must be >= 1.}

\item{M}{Modulus for the generator (default = 2^30 = 1073741824). Must be a
power of two for efficient computation. The default provides approximately
30 bits of precision.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{n} containing pseudo-random uniform
  values in the interval [0, 1).
}
\description{
Implements the Additive Congruential Random Number (ACORN) generator,
a high-quality pseudorandom number generator based on additive lagged
Fibonacci sequences. The generator uses the recurrence relation:
Y[i] = (Y[i-1] + Y[i-2] + ... + Y[i-k-1]) mod M
}
\details{
The ACORN generator maintains a state vector of k+1 previous values and
generates new values by summing all previous values modulo M. This additive
structure provides good statistical properties and a long period.

Key properties:
\itemize{
  \item Period length increases with order k
  \item k = 10 is recommended for general use (balances quality and speed)
  \item M must be a power of 2 for efficient modulo operations
  \item All generated values are in [0, 1) with resolution 1/M
}
}
\section{Performance}{

Computational cost increases linearly with k. For k = 1, the generator is
very fast but has limited statistical quality. For k = 10, it provides
excellent quality at moderate computational cost.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate 1000 random numbers with default settings (k=1)
rng1 <- acorn(seed = 12345, n = 1000)

# Use recommended order k=10 for better quality
rng10 <- acorn(seed = 12345, n = 1000, k = 10)

# Custom modulus (must be power of 2)
rng_custom <- acorn(seed = 54321, n = 500, k = 5, M = 2^20)

# Verify uniform distribution
